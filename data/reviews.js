      "I've been using Mounjaro 2.5mg for 3 months now, and my blood sugar levels have never been more stable. As a bonus, I've lost 8kg without even trying! The injection is easy to administer and I've had minimal side effects. Highly recommended for anyone struggling with type 2 diabetes.",

      "Mounjaro has been very effective for my weight management. I started with 2.5mg and now I'm on 5mg. I've lost 12kg in 4 months! However, I did experience nausea and some digestive issues in the first few weeks. These side effects have diminished over time. Worth it for the results.",

      "After trying both Ozempic and Wegovy with limited success, my doctor recommended Mounjaro. The dual action on GLP-1 and GIP receptors makes a noticeable difference. My glucose control is excellent and I've lost 15kg in 5 months. The price in India is also more reasonable than in the US.",

    content:
      "Mounjaro works well for my diabetes management, but I find the storage requirements challenging. It needs refrigeration, which can be difficult during travel. I wish there was a room-temperature stable version. Otherwise, the medication itself is effective.",

      "I've been struggling with obesity for years and tried everything. My doctor prescribed Mounjaro 5mg and it's been transformative. I've lost 18kg in 6 months with proper diet and exercise. The appetite suppression effect is remarkable. Worth every rupee!",

      "Mounjaro has been very effective for managing my blood sugar levels. I've been using it for 4 months and have seen significant improvements in my HbA1c. The only downside is the cost - even in India, it's still quite expensive for long-term use. I hope the price comes down as it becomes more widely available.",
