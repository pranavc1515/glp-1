    question: "Is GLP-1 treatment safe for weight loss?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when prescribed and monitored by qualified medical professionals, GLP-1 medications are safe and clinically proven for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity. These medications are FDA-approved, commonly used for people with diabetes, PCOS, and insulin resistance. Your safety is our top priority - that's why we combine medication with regular check-ins, blood tests, and nutrition coaching.",

    question: "What are the side effects of GLP-1 injections?",
    answer:
      "Most people experience mild and temporary side effects, especially during the first few weeks. Common side effects include nausea or queasiness, constipation or occasional diarrhea, bloating or gas, and fatigue or lightheadedness in some cases. These usually settle within 2–4 weeks and can be managed with dietary tweaks, rest and hydration, and medication dose adjustments if needed. Serious side effects are rare, and you'll always have access to our doctor and support team.",

    question: "How long do I need to be on the medication?",
    answer: "The average duration is 6–12 months, depending on your starting weight, health goals, and how your body responds. The program is designed in phases: Kickstart Phase (1–3 months) where medication begins and nutrition changes start, Active Weight Loss Phase (3–6+ months) with regular fat loss and habit building, and Taper & Transition Phase where we slowly reduce medication while continuing coaching. Our goal is not just weight loss but long-term weight maintenance through habits and support.",

    question: "Will I gain weight back after stopping the medication?",
    answer: "Not if we do it right. Weight regain can happen if you stop medication suddenly, return to old eating habits, or don't have a support system. But our program is different. We help you build sustainable eating habits, manage emotional eating triggers, transition off medication gradually, and stay supported even after the program ends. With the right structure, most clients maintain or even continue weight loss after stopping the medication.",

    answer:

Individual results vary based on starting weight, adherence to the program, lifestyle factors, and metabolic health. Our medical team will set realistic expectations during your consultation based on your specific situation.",

We recommend that you purchase from them. Our doctors will provide you with a prescription that you can use at any licensed pharmacy.",
